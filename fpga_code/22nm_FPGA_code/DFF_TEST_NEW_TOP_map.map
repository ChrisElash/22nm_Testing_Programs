Phase 7.2  Initial Clock and IO Placement

........
WARNING:Place:644 - A clock IOB clock component is not placed at an optimal
   clock IOB site. The clock IOB component <O_INV> is placed at site <AE34>. The
   clock IO site can use the fast path between the IO and the Clock buffer/GCLK
   if the IOB is placed in the master Clock IOB Site. This is normally an ERROR
   but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN <O_INV.PAD>
   allowing your design to continue. This constraint disables all clock placer
   rules related to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of this override is highly
   discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended
   that this error condition be corrected in the design.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
