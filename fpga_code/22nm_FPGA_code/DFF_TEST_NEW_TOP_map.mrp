  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Place:644 - A clock IOB clock component is not placed at an optimal
   clock IOB site. The clock IOB component <O_INV> is placed at site <AE34>. The
   clock IO site can use the fast path between the IO and the Clock buffer/GCLK
   if the IOB is placed in the master Clock IOB Site. This is normally an ERROR
   but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN <O_INV.PAD>
   allowing your design to continue. This constraint disables all clock placer
   rules related to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of this override is highly
   discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended
   that this error condition be corrected in the design.

INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:MapLib:856 - PLL_ADV CLK_GEN_TOP/CLK_GEN/PLL_ADV_INST CLKIN2 pin was
   disconnected because a constant 1 is driving the CLKINSEL pin.

   INTERNAL for PLL_ADV CLK_GEN_TOP/CLK_GEN/PLL_ADV_INST.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   4 block(s) removed
   2 block(s) optimized away
   4 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Loadless block "CLK_GEN_TOP/CLK_GEN/CLKOUT1_BUFG_INST" (CKBUF) removed.
 The signal "CLK_GEN_TOP/CLK_GEN/CLKOUT1_BUF" is loadless and has been removed.
Loadless block "CLK_GEN_TOP/CLK_GEN/CLKOUT2_BUFG_INST" (CKBUF) removed.
 The signal "CLK_GEN_TOP/CLK_GEN/CLKOUT2_BUF" is loadless and has been removed.
Loadless block "CLK_GEN_TOP/CLK_GEN/CLKOUT3_BUFG_INST" (CKBUF) removed.
 The signal "CLK_GEN_TOP/CLK_GEN/CLKOUT3_BUF" is loadless and has been removed.
Loadless block "CLK_GEN_TOP/CLK_GEN/CLKOUT4_BUFG_INST" (CKBUF) removed.
 The signal "CLK_GEN_TOP/CLK_GEN/CLKOUT4_BUF" is loadless and has been removed.

Optimized Block(s):
TYPE 		BLOCK
GND 		XST_GND
VCC 		XST_VCC

detailed map report option and rerun map.

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
